fcshd - a cross-platform convenience wrapper around fcsh shell.

fcshd is written in PHP and consists of a simple server and a client.

fcshd supports all fcsh commands and also adds its own mxmlcsmart command which
can be used instead of mxmlc/compile commands. In fcsh one has to initially
create the compile target by invoking the mxmlc command, remember the compile
target id and later use this id with compile command for incremental builds.
The mxmlcsmart command does all of this hassle for you, just use it for
painfree incremental builds.
