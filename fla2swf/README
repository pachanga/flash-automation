fla2swf is a command line utility written in PHP which can be used in a batch
mode for publishing .fla files to .swf. 

fla2swf consists of the client and server parts. The cool thing behind this
utility is the fact the client can be run on the box without Flash IDE
installed(even on the *nix box). Of course, you will need the server to be run
on the workstation with the Flash authoring environment installed.
